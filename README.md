# PuppersName

Small Project from naming new puppy. I did this to practice my data analyst skills. Very simple data collection, cleaning, and Tableau work.

## Who

The Girlfriend and I are getting a new puppy. He is a Cane Corso. This is him:

## What We Did

We started a naming tournament bracket to find the lil guys name check it out here:

The rules of the naming tournament were this..
ON the count of three we would each say the name we liked more.
IF we agreed on the name, the name would win.
IF we disagreed on the name, we would use a coinflip to decide who won.

On Round 3 I started tracking if we agreed or disagreed. As well as who won the coin flips. This is where the data comes from.

### The Scoring System

Agreed = If we both said the same name.
Disagreed = If we said different names.

## Conclusion
Altough we haven't decided on a name. I wanted to visualized how unfair this kind of system for chosing a name would be. 'Appa' had the most points, but did not end up in the finals. As well as some names we really liked being eliminated early. Due to this fact. We have decided to go for round 2 of the naming process. More to come later.
