We started a naming tournament bracket to find the lil guys name check it out here:

The rules of the naming tournament were this..
ON the count of three we would each say the name we liked more.
IF we agreed on the name, the name would win.
IF we disagreed on the name, we would use a coinflip to decide who won.

On Round 3 I started tracking if we agreed or disagreed. As well as who won the coin flips. This is where the data comes from.
